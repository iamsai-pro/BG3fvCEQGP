Okay, I understand the task. I will act as a UI/UX designer and senior front-end engineer to create a highly interactive and complex personal portfolio website. The website will be built using semantic HTML5, modular CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with all content sourced *exclusively* from the provided JSON data.

**Crucially, I will adhere to the strict content rules:**
*   **ALL website content MUST come ONLY from the JSON data provided.**
*   I will NOT invent, guess, or add any information.
*   I will NOT use placeholder text.
*   If a section or field is empty or missing in the JSON, it will be **hidden completely**.

I am ready to receive the JSON data. Once provided, I will begin constructing the website based on the described design principles and technical requirements.

Please provide the JSON data when you are ready.
